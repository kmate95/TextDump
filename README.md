TextDump
========

Most simple text container for quick notes or copy/paste cache.

This was just a one minute project, I needed somewhere to paste things I'll need later and Notepad was too big.

Features
========
- This one has no brain, you can't load or save files, but current text is preserved between uses.
- As default the window is always on top, you can toggle it with double clicking on the "Always on top" text
- There is a "Clear" button to start over

Plans
========
- Maybe to save windows position
- Fill the window with empty line to be able to start typing anywhere

No guarantee to do any of these
